One of the goals of biology is to match genotype, our inherited molecular code, with phenotypes, our traits. The availability of large amounts of genetic data, including GWAS studies, permits scientists to investigate the relationship between genes and traits. This is particularly valuable for traits indicated in diseases. 

Examination of genes, through assessment of single nucleotide polymorphisms, has shown that the relationship between phenotype and genotype is rarely a 1:1 relationship. Often, proteins coded by genes interact with various proteins and influence various phenotypes.  

To characterized the association between genotype and phenotype, systems biologists study networks of interacting genes, proteins, and traits. Bioinformatics methods are used to gain insights into the patterns of gene exprssion and protein interactions.

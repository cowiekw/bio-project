## Step 1. Clean Data in R Studio 
**A)**
1.Open the Drug Indications R Project
2.Inspect the MEDI HPS 2013 data. 
3.Import it into R studio (drug_indications_data.rmd)
4.Modify column names and view the data structure. 
5.Export as lowercase_drug_indications_data_full.xlsx

**B)**
Summarize the numbers of drugs indicated for each unique indication. Save the output as "number_of_indications.xlsx"

**Issue:** In the MEDI dataset, each row corresponds to a drug. I need to reformat the data so that, each rows is a disease. 

## Step 2. Rearrange disease indications data in Python. 
1. Using python, import pandas. 
2. Load the file "lowercase_drug_indications_data_full.xlsx" into a pandas dataframe. 
3. Split the dataframe into 2 subsets: One new dataframe with indications + icd codes and one with indications and drug description. 
4. Apply the funciton groupby the to the indications+drug descripition data. Group by each unique indication (i.e. disease). Compile all of the drugs associated with that indication into one column. 
5. Merge the grouped indication +drug data with the dataframe containing indications +icd codes. 
6. Inspect the new dataframe. 
7. Load the file "number_of_indications.xlsx"
8. Merge number of indications with the dataframe. 
9. The modified dataframe should describe:  Indication | ICD9 | Drug_Desc | Number of Indications


## Step 3. Subset Disease Coherene Data in R 

From the Disease Coherence data, exclude columns that are not relevant to this analysis. Include disease, string coherence, and string_filtered coherence. 

[View the Colab Notebook](merge-coherence-wide-indications.ipynb) to see the code. 

## Step 4. Merge the revised drug indications data with the subset of disease coherence data. 

Use the package fuzzy wuzzy. 
1. Import the subset disease coherence data 

## Step 5
Revise the merged data. "disease_coherence_fuzzy_outer."

Remove rows with not corresponding disease. 

Manually match remaining data.
